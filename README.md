Website that allows users to share predictions about their favorite shows, sports, movies etc.

Website is built with:
backend - php(processing ), apache2
frontend - sass(css), react.js, jquery

Massive project, a social networking site you could say. Mainly was dont for the purpose learning and practice.
Project is left unfinished and maybe will continued in the future. 

Main challenges that required some thinking to do: 
1) generating comment section(infinitely threaded, same as Reddit comment section as an example) under created post 
2) Creating backend engine with php
3) Creating database queries in a way it would be no difficult to modify in the future(there were a lot of queries and needed to find a way maybe to avoid dublicatin query code).
4) There were also plenty of different small challenging tasks that need to solve.

Main functionality: 
1) User creates a post that has a prediction of the target event(sports etc.) or tv show episode/movie.
The user also ADDS A DATE when the event happens or movie/tvshow is released. This important because users can give another rating later on.(point 3)

2) Other Users can upvote or downvote if they think the prediction is very good or bad. Users also can leave their comment under the post.
3) When the release date sadsdsa current date, the upvote/downvote functionalityy locks and is replaced with rating function where users can vote from 1-5 if they think the prediction was spot on or not.

4) Users can sort and search posts based on keywords, genre, popularity. 


1) release date of the next episode of a popular show for example. 
It also can be a prediction of the outcome in popular sports
 and 
after the release date(Two separate Â´voting stages. 
First stage is when users can upvote or downwote depends if they like the prediction 
Second stage is after the release date when users rate with points from 0 to 5 in order to see users prediction accuracy.
).

Users can also create their own threads/communities.
